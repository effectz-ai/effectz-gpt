Cooperation can take place in the form of professional practice, work practice, language practice, language training, summer temporary work, expanded recruitment or employment. It can also involve standing up as a sponsoring company for students from e.g. adapted upper secondary school or adult education's vocational program (so-called workplace-based learning APL).
