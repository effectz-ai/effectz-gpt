Temporary change to support's opening hours and the reason for this. This condition can be renegotiated if the Customer's conditions change.

1.6 Misclassification

Errors must be classified in different priority levels as below:

|Critical Error (Priority 1)|Errors that prevent production in the IT system. Downtime/operation interruptions, security loopholes or the like that make classified information available to unauthorized persons. Has a very large impact on the business and/or the users' ability to use the IT system. A substantial part of, or all users are affected. Errors that affect confidentiality, legal certainty, patient safety or the correctness of the processing.|
|---|---|
|Serious Errors (Priority 2)|Errors that do not hinder production in the IT system but that inhibit the efficiency and use of the IT system. Errors that have an impact on the ability of certain user groups to use the IT system. The error affects a small part of the users or an area of operation. That the IT system allows the user to make mistakes that affect confidentiality, legal certainty, patient safety or the correctness of the processing.|
|Significant error (Priority 3)|Errors of a minor nature that do not significantly impede effective use. Affects a few users but business can continue as usual.|
|Minor errors (Priority 4)|Inaccuracy with little or no impact. Minor deviations or cosmetic defects, low level of defects that only require the activation of troubleshooting by appointment. For example, errors in guiding texts, documentation or help texts.|

Reaction time: The time within the agreed service time that runs from the time the Customer reports a fault until the Supplier with relevant competence begins the work with qualified fault finding and fault rectification. Agreed reaction time, see matrix below.

Action time
---
# APPENDIX 5

# SLA MANAGEMENT SERVICE AND SUPPORT

GNU 2024/81

The time, within and outside the agreed support time, that elapses from
the time the Supplier begins work on the error and until the error is
rectified.
For error classification Priority 2, 3 and 4 reaction time and action time
are counted working days excluding weekends 8:00 - 16:30.
In the event of a critical error (Priority 1), the Supplier must work
continuously even outside of agreed support, on the condition that the
Orderer cooperates with the Supplier to the extent the Supplier deems
necessary.
A prerequisite for the Supplier to be able to act according to the response
time is that the Customer guarantees infrastructure and accessibility to
the system solution for remote troubleshooting.

|Misclassification|Reaction time|Action time|
|---|---|---|
|Critical Error (Priority 1)|30 min|4 hours|
|Serious Error (Priority 2)|1.5 hours|8 hours|
|Significant error (Priority 3)|8 hours|80 hours (10 working days)|
|Minor errors (Priority 4)|12 hours|According to agreement.|

Misclassification of faults and their priority is proposed by the Customer.
The supplier can, after the customer's approval, change the classification
of a fault. The customer must change the classification of a case that has
been notified if the customer considers that errors, for example due to
changed circumstances, should be assessed in a different way.
Errors must be well described (how the error occurs, where the error
occurs, which groups/roles are affected, when the error occurs).
The Supplier is entitled to compensation for additional costs in cases
where the Supplier is forced to act as if it were an error of a higher
priority order and the Supplier can demonstrate that the error should
have been classified as an error of a lower priority level.

# APPENDIX 5

# SLA MANAGEMENT SERVICE AND SUPPORT

GNU 2024/81

If the Supplier cannot solve a critical or serious error, the Orderer, after consultation with the Supplier, has the right to engage another external resource at the Supplier's expense.

# 1.7 Registration and case management

All support cases linked to the IT system are handled by the Supplier in a case management system. When registering and changing a case, a message is sent to the notifier, with a description and a case number, which can be used in contact with support.

Employees must be able to have a support/case management function for the users and communicate via the IT system with a connection to the respective case/document where it is clear who it concerns and who submitted the request.

The status and history of the support cases must be in the case management system and can be shared with the Customer if necessary.

There must be a categorization of support cases for easy follow-up and analysis (for example, bug, processing error, activity/function, question, error rectified -, not rectified within action time). When signing the contract, the Customer and the Supplier agree on which categories are to be applied.

# 1.8 Release/version management

Changes are provided as updates (releases, editions, versions or software updates) with, where applicable, associated documentation. The supplier must have a continuous development plan with predefined dates for releases and upgrades of the IT system and have tested these internally before they are sent to the customer. The Supplier shall issue guarantees that updates do not adversely affect functions and functionality if carried out according to the Supplier's instructions.

The supplier must continuously inform the customer about IT system development and new versions.

The supplier must, in good time (no later than 14 days) before the new version/change of the IT system is available, inform about the content of the new version and the possible actions that these cause on the part of the customer.

Upgrades, updates and versions must be quality assured by the Supplier before delivery. The supplier must therefore have a methodology for delivery checks and verifications for updates/upgrades (releases). If errors and deficiencies in the delivered function/adaptation are

# APPENDIX 5

# SLA MANAGEMENT SERVICE AND SUPPORT

GNU 2024/81

Discovered/appear, the error must be rectified as soon as possible at no extra cost to the Customer. Information in the IT system as well as customized additional functionality must not be lost during upgrades, updates and version changes.

# Management and development

The supplier is aware that the technical development on the market is extensive and takes place quickly. It is therefore of great importance that the Supplier updates and changes the IT system from time to time in accordance with the rest of the market. The supplier must continuously develop the IT system throughout the duration of the contract. The supplier must, together with the customer, continuously work on further development with the aim of improving and streamlining the IT system.

# Reconciliation meetings

The supplier and the customer must work for a well-functioning dialogue on three different levels to ensure a high quality of the delivery. The customer is the convener and the supplier must document the meeting in written meeting minutes. Meetings must take place at the Customer's place or via Teams if so agreed.

# Agreement level

Meeting at contract level refers to reconciliation of the contract, including, among other things, safety and quality issues and contract conditions. Meetings at agreement level are held once/year, extra meetings can be initiated if necessary.

# Management level (system management)

Management meetings refer to the review of statistics and reports, development and change needs, operational parts regarding the delivery, i.e. operation, implementation of measures, reporting/follow-up of the fulfillment of service levels and training needs. These meetings are held once/quarter, extra meetings can be initiated if necessary.

# Documentation

The Customer has the right to request documentation and/or reports from the Supplier in order to ensure that delivery takes place in accordance with the Agreement. If the Customer wishes, the Supplier must deliver.
