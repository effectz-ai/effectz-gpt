Sanctions against Russia and Belarus

According to the Publications Office (europa.eu) regulation, it is now prohibited to award contracts or allow public contracts or concession contracts to be carried out with both legal and natural persons established in Russia or Belarus with reference to EU sanctions against Russia and Belarus.

The ban also applies to subcontractors and companies whose capacity is invoked in the procurement if the invoked company accounts for more than 10 percent of the contract's value. The Procurement Center needs to ensure that the contracted Supplier complies with this regulation.

The contracted Supplier must therefore confirm that the following is fulfilled during the contract period:

1. Certification that the Supplier is not subject to the sanctions- not directly or indirectly covered by the sanctions- will not use subcontractors etc. that are covered by the sanctions, or invoke the capacity of such actors in the procurement within the framework of the contractual relationship- will not participate in the purchase, import or transport of such products and services that are subject to EU import restrictions

2. Information about conditions changes- will immediately inform the procuring organization if there is reason to suspect that the conditions according to above change, including if new sanctions are decided by the EU that directly or indirectly include the Supplier or the contractual relationship of the parties

- must immediately inform the procuring organization if the Supplier's legal status, ownership or representation means, or changes in such a way, that it is subject to the sanctions

- must immediately inform the procuring organization if there is reason to suspect that the conditions are such that a subcontractor or an invoked company is covered by the sanctions

# 3. To cooperate fully

The supplier certifies that he:

- will fully cooperate in matters relating to compliance with the sanctions and provide the information necessary in this regard. The above is certified by signature.

Make sure that the connections to the supplier data are working. Remember to save it as a pdf so that it becomes part of the signed agreement.
