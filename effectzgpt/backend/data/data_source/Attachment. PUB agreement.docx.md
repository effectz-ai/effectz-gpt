The assistant must take the following security measures when processing the Personal Data:

[In order for the Personal Data Controller or the Personal Data Assistant to be able to assess which security measures the Sub-Assistant needs to take, the Sub-Assistant needs to report technical documentation and system specification regarding the current service or system that clarifies how Personal Data is handled and protected within the framework of the service or system. Relevant information can also be found in the Assistant's privacy policy (Privacy Policy). Based on the documentation, the Personal Data Controller or the Personal Data Assistant can assess which measures, if any, need to be adapted or supplemented to achieve a sufficient level of protection for the Personal Data in order to preserve the protection of the Data Subject's personal integrity. This information may well appear in a separate appendix.

All technical and organizational security measures that the Personal Data Controller requires the Personal Data Assistant or Sub-Assistant to take must be stated in this section, if applicable, with reference to one or more annexes. The detailed content and design of the requirements are determined based on the Personal Data Controller's risk and vulnerability analyses, e.g. information security classification or impact assessment regarding data protection according to article 35 of the data protection regulation, as well as through dialogue with the Personal Data Protection Officer. The security measures must be dimensioned according to the nature, scope and purpose of the Processing as well as the risks to the Data Subject's privacy.

The measures can, for example, be listed under the following subheadings: Organizational security measures, Security measures regarding people, Physical security measures and Technical security measures (see ISO/IEC 27002).

Organizational security measures may refer to requirements regarding e.g. division of responsibilities and roles, governing documents, risk and incident
