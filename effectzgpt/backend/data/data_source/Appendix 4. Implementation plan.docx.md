# 1 Implementation plan

The parties must agree in writing on a project organization and implementation plan, based on the following points, no later than 30 working days, or as agreed, after signing the agreement:

Example below:

Time and activity plan with milestones for:- Integrations- Authorization control and parameter setting- Installation test environment- Installation operating environment- Input of current documentation (processing, decisions, etc.) from previous operational systems for the possibility of "rolling out" the IT system- Training opportunities based on roles/profession (number of opportunities and participants/time)- Implementation with a rollout plan for the operations, based on previous experiences- Function and acceptance tests of the IT system- Handover to administration

The supplier's project organization- Roles in the project  - Key resources in the implementation including support before handover to management- Distribution of responsibilities of the parties  - Resources required by the Customer  - Resources required from the Supplier

Forum for reconciliation meetings to ensure the project's progress- When on time based on set time and activity plan, time interval and participants (roles) affected by Supplier and Orderer

This implementation plan must be signed by both parties. After signing, the planning phase starts, which means setting up the technical environment and integrations, to be followed by the actual implementation for the start-up of the business. The supplier must plan for one and the same contact person/function throughout the implementation.

If the establishment of the implementation plan is delayed unilaterally by the supplier, and that the supplier does not participate in the establishment of the implementation plan after written notice, the

Ordering Party may demand a fine according to clause 3.9.1 of the Agreement.

# 1.2 Agreed delivery date

The agreed delivery date is 8 calendar months from the start of installation, unless otherwise agreed. Upon final delivery, the Customer must, after a completed test and delivery control period, approve the delivery of the IT system according to section 1.9. When delivery is approved, the implementation project ends and the IT system transitions to the management phase and SLA according to Appendix 5. SLA service and support begins to apply.

# 1.3 Training during the introduction

Upon introduction, the Supplier must provide role-appropriate training, which takes place at the Customer's premises or, if agreed, digitally (via e.g. MS Teams). The training must ensure that the Customer has sufficient knowledge to be able to manage the system. The customer chooses himself who will go this and/or these people will in turn act as internal trainers of other users. Ongoing training and support must be provided by the Supplier throughout the Implementation Plan. Role-based training and training materials that customers after training have the right to use.

# 1.4 Coordination meetings during the introduction

The supplier and the customer must work for a well-functioning dialogue to ensure a high quality of the delivery. Written meeting minutes must be drawn up and documented at these meetings and served on the Customer/Supplier. Meetings take place at the Customer's place or via MS Teams, if so agreed. Time intervals, follow-up points, standing agenda and roles for participation in these coordination meetings are detailed in consultation between the Orderer and the Supplier.

# 1.5 Test and delivery control

Test and delivery control means that the Customer ensures that the IT system meets the requirements set out in the agreed specification.
---
# APPENDIX 4. IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

If tests or inspections do not meet the requirements or functionality, a new test and delivery inspection period begins after the supplier corrects the problem. The customer decides to what extent control of the measure is carried out.

The Customer carries out the test and delivery control period with appointed persons from the Customer. The tests will be carried out based on the business with the associated 20 working day delivery control period. Details for this are set in the timetable for the introduction project in consultation between the Customer and the Supplier.

After the test and delivery control period, the Customer must approve the delivery provided that no errors according to priority order 1-3, according to point 1.6, are detected.

# 1.6 Procedure, suspension and resumption criteria

Errors encountered during the test and delivery control period are reported to the Supplier in the form of a specially prepared protocol. Occurred errors are ranked in the following order of priority.

|Priority|Error Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|1|Critical errors|Serious errors that hinder production in the IT system. Downtime/operation interruptions, security loopholes or the like that make classified information available to unauthorized persons.|
|2|Serious errors|Errors that do not hinder production in the IT system, but inhibit the efficiency and use of the system.|
|3|Significant error|Errors of a less serious nature and which do not significantly impede effective use.|
|4|Minor errors|Inaccuracy with little or no impact. For example, errors in guiding texts, documentation or help texts.|

The test and delivery control period is only completed when the completed and documented test protocol has been approved by the Customer.
